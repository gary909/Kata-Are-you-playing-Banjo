    <h1>Kata: Are you playing Banjo?</h1>
    <h3>Open the console...</h3>
    <p>
      Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?".<br />
      If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing
      banjo!<br />

      The function takes a name as its only argument, and returns one of the
      <br />
      following strings:<br />
      <br />
      name + " plays banjo" <br />
      name + " does not play banjo"<br />
      Names given are always valid strings.<br />
